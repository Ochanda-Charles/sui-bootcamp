- Understand Sui's execution model and how object ownership replaces global state
- Learn the difference between owned and shared objects
- Visualize how validators handle transactions using object IDs and causal relationships

**Mini Activity:**
- Draw the lifecycle of an object (creation, update, deletion)
- Follow a transaction flow involving object versioning

---

### **Night 3: Introduction to the Move Language (Part 1)**
**Learning Objectives:**
- Learn Move syntax: keywords, modules, structs, entry functions
- Understand how Move ensures memory and resource safety
- Write and compile your first Move module

**Mini Activity:**
- Write a Move function that returns a string: "Hello, Sui!"
- Compile it using the Sui CLI and deploy it locally

---

### **Night 4: Move Language (Part 2) ‚Äî Storage, Objects & Ownership**
**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the role of UID and the object system in Sui
- Learn about & (immutable reference) and &mut (mutable reference)
- Explore how access control is done via ownership

**Mini Activity:**

- Add minting logic that assigns ownership based on sender address

---

## üîß Phase 2: Smart Contract Development (Nights 6‚Äì10)

### **Night 6: Advanced Move Programming**
**Learning Objectives:**
- Explore capabilities: tokens that grant permission to mutate other objects
- Create and consume resources dynamically
- Reuse code via helper functions and modular patterns

**Mini Activity:**

---

### **Night 7: Gas & Transaction Optimization**
**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand how gas is measured and charged in Sui
- Learn strategies to write gas-efficient contracts
- Understand object size and complexity impact on gas

**Mini Activity:**
- Compare gas usage of different struct layouts
- Benchmark two different transaction flows with `sui move test` output

---

### **Night 8: Testing & Debugging Move Contracts**
**Learning Objectives:**
- Write unit tests using the Move testing framework
- Use `sui move test` to write assert-based tests
- Trace and debug failed transactions or assertions

**Mini Activity:**
- Test and debug a contract where a user can transfer tokens conditionally

---

### **Night 9: Sui Framework & External Libraries**
**Learning Objectives:**
- Import and use system modules (e.g., `coin::Coin`, `transfer::Transfer`)
- Explore common patterns (minting, transferring, burning)
