## 2. Request via Discord Bot

Sui's Discord server offers a faucet bot for Testnet & Devnet tokens.

### üìù Steps:
1. Join the official Sui Discord [here](https://discord.com/invite/sui)
2. Go to the `#testnet-faucet` or `#devnet-faucet` channel.
3. Use the command:

```
!faucet <your-address>
```
For example to request from this wallet , `0xd8133d487f2bd59baf4906ba1b76e29504dd8ab7900a2b1ff4d489eab88d59b1` this is how the command would look like:
```
!faucet 0xd8133d487f2bd59baf4906ba1b76e29504dd8ab7900a2b1ff4d489eab88d59b1
```
4. Tokens will be sent to your wallet in a few seconds.

## 3. Request via cURL
Use the following cURL command to request tokens directly from the faucet server.
In this case we'll be requesting devnet tokens.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://faucet.devnet.sui.io/v1/gas' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "FixedAmountRequest": {
        "recipient": "<YOUR SUI ADDRESS>"
    }
}'
```
for testnet you just proceed to replace `devnet` with `testnet` in the url to look like this;

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://faucet.testnet.sui.io/v1/gas' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "FixedAmountRequest": {
        "recipient": "<YOUR SUI ADDRESS>"
    }
}'
```

The output should look like this:
